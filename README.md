# Codecademy's Off-Platform Project
## Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts
___
In this project, I created a website for Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts store based on a given design spec using **HTML** and **CSS**. 

*Note*: 
- My solution implements semantic HTML more effectively than the provided Codecademy solution (`section` as opposed to `div` containers were used)
