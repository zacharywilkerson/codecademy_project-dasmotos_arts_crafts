# Codecademy: Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts
## Off-Platform Project

This project was designed to create a website for Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts store based on a given design spec. 

My site for Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts ([live](https://zacharywilkerson.github.io/codecademy_project-dasmotos_arts_crafts/)) is available through Github Pages. Feel free to have a look (preview below)!
